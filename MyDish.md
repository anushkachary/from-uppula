###### My favorite Food - Idli

Idli is a traditional South Indian dish known for its light, fluffy texture and mild flavor. It consists of steamed rice cakes made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). The fermentation process not only enhances the idli's taste but also makes it easily digestible and rich in beneficial bacteria.

 Often enjoyed as a breakfast item or as part of a meal, idlis are typically served with an array of accompaniments, including coconut chutney, sambar (a spicy lentil stew), and various other side dishes. This versatile and nutritious dish is beloved for its simplicity, health benefits, and its role in Indian culinary culture.

###### Dart Code Snippet

This Dart code snippet demonstrates the use of the ternary operator to conditionally execute a function. In the main() function, it defines a constant someValue with a value of 3. It then uses the ternary operator to choose between two functions, func1 and func2, based on the condition someValue == 4. If the condition is true, func1 is called; otherwise, func2 is called. Since someValue is 3 (not equal to 4), func2 is called, and the output will be "func 2 called".

```
void func1(){
 print("func 1 called");
}

void func2(){
 print("func 2 called");
}

void main() {
 const someValue = 3;
 (someValue == 4? func1 : func2)();
}
```
