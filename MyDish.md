###### My favorite Food - Idli

Idli is a traditional South Indian dish known for its light, fluffy texture and mild flavor. It consists of steamed rice cakes made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). The fermentation process not only enhances the idli's taste but also makes it easily digestible and rich in beneficial bacteria.

This versatile and nutritious dish is beloved for its simplicity, health benefits, and its role in Indian culinary culture.
